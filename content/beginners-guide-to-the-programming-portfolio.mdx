## Overview

This project demonstrates an end-to-end integration where data from SharePoint is processed using AWS Cloud services, with automation and infrastructure management handled by Terraform. The workflow involves various AWS services like Lambda, S3, Step Functions, and AWS Bedrock. The goal is to efficiently process data from SharePoint and prepare Knowledge bases for GenAI chatbot.

## Prerequisites

- **SharePoint Access:** Ensure access to the SharePoint environment where data will be uploaded.
- **AWS Account:** A valid AWS account with access to the following services: AWS Lambda, Amazon S3, AWS Step Functions, AWS Bedrock, AWS EventBridge.
- **Terraform Setup:** Terraform should be installed and configured to manage the AWS infrastructure.
- **IAM Roles and Permissions:** Correct IAM roles with necessary permissions for Lambda, S3, and Bedrock should be in place to execute the tasks.

- **Show code:** Ideally links to GitHub repositories, including live demo URLs where I can see the things you've built. I'll go explore the codebase and see what tech choices you used. Bonus points if you wrote about _why_ you picked that tech stack.
- **Write stuff:** An average engineer who can write well and explain concepts clearly is better than an excellent engineer who can't communicate with their coworkers. Show me you are a clear writer, which is especially important if the role is remote.
- **Own your SEO:** Google yourself and make sure you own the first page (not always easy, but worth influencing). Capture a domain name and build credibility. You might end up keeping that "digital home" throughout your career.
- **Make it unique:** Express yourself. Use a creative design. Spent the extra hour on the [animation polish](https://delba.dev/blog/a-like-button-that-likes-you-back). Add something unique you haven't seen others do before.
- **Show, don't tell:** You _said_ you have experience with React â€“ show me.
